Sexual abuse is the most frequent cause of gonococcal infection in preadolescent children (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). For preadolescent girls, vaginitis is the most common manifestation of this infection; gonococcal-associated PID after vaginal infection is likely less common in preadolescents than adults. Among sexually abused children, anorectal and pharyngeal infections with N. gonorrhoeae are common and frequently asymptomatic.

### Diagnostic Considerations

NAATs can be used for vaginal and urine specimens from girls (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children), however there are insufficient data to recommend the use of NAATs for use in boys and extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in boys and girls. Culture remains the preferred526 method for diagnosis for boys and extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in boys and girls . Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. If evidence of disseminated gonococcal infection, gonorrhea culture and antimicrobial susceptibililty testing should be obtained from relevant clinical sites (see DGI).
