### Treatment

Parenteral penicillin G has been used effectively for more than 50 years to achieve clinical resolution (i.e., the healing of lesions and prevention of sexual transmission) and to prevent late sequelae. However, no high quality comparative trials have been conducted to guide the selection of an optimal penicillin regimen. Substantially fewer data are available for nonpenicillin regimens.

Available data demonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in primary and secondary syphilis do not enhance efficacy, regardless of HIV status 396,397.

Infants and children aged â‰¥1 month with acquired primary and secondary syphilis should be evaluated for sexual abuse (e.g., through consultation with child-protection services) (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).
