Latent syphilis is defined as syphilis characterized by seroreactivity without other evidence of disease. Persons who have latent syphilis and who acquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as having early latent syphilis. Patients can be diagnosed with early latent syphilis if, during the year preceding the diagnosis, they had 1) a documented seroconversion or a sustained for more than 2 weeks fourfold or greater increase in titer of a nontreponemal test; 2) unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis; or 3) a sex partner documented to have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only possible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, early latent syphilis can be assumed. In the absence of these conditions, an asymptomatic person should be considered to have late latent syphilis. Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are higher during early latent syphilis than late latent syphilis. However, early latent syphilis cannot be reliably distinguished from late latent syphilis solely on the basis of nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should have careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces (i.e., the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum and vagina in women, and underneath the foreskin in uncircumcised men) to evaluate for internal mucosal lesions.

### Treatment

Because latent syphilis is not transmitted sexually (except in persons with early latent syphilis who relapse into the secondary stage), the objective of treating persons with this stage of disease is to prevent complications and transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Although clinical experience supports the effectiveness of penicillin in achieving this goal, limited evidence is available to guide choice of specific regimens or duration.

Available data demonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in early latent syphilis do not enhance efficacy, regardless of HIV infection 396,397.

Infants and children aged â‰¥1 month who have been diagnosed with latent syphilis should have a CSF examination to exclude neurosyphilis. In addition, birth and maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess whether they have congenital or acquired syphilis (see Congenital Syphilis). Those with acquired latent syphilis should be evaluated as described for adults (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). These regimens are for penicillin nonallergic children who have acquired syphilis and who have normal CSF examination results.
