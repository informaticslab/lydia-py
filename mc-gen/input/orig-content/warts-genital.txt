### Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection. The diagnosis of anogenital warts can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical such as pigmented, indurated, fixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated. Biopsy might also be indicated if: 1) the diagnosis is uncertain; or 2) the lesions do not respond to standard therapy; or 3) the disease worsens during therapy. Biopsy should be considered in these circumstances especially if the patient is immunocompromised (including HIV infection).

The use of HPV DNA testing for anogenital wart diagnosis is not recommended, because test results do not confirm the diagnosis and do not assist with genital warts management.

The application of 3%–5% acetic acid, which might cause affected areas to turn white, has been used by some providers to detect HPV-infected genital mucosa. However, acetic acid application is not a specific test for HPV infection and treatment of these findings without macroscopic or pathologic precancerous lesions is of unknown benefit. Therefore, the routine use of this procedure for screening to detect mucosal changes attributed to HPV infection is not recommended.

### Treatment

Most genital warts are asymptomatic; however, symptoms when they occur include itching, pain, and bleeding. The appearance of warts can also result in significant psychosocialdistress. The aim of treatment is removal of the wart and amelioration of symptoms, if present. In most patients, treatment results in resolution of the wart(s). If left untreated, anogenital warts can resolve on there own, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Because warts may spontaneously resolve within a year, an acceptable alternative for some persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for anogenital warts may reduce, but probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether the reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting from treatment reduces future transmission remains unclear.

#### Recommended Regimens

Treatment of anogenital warts should be guided by the preference of the patient, available resources, and the experience of the health-care provider. No definitive evidence suggests that any of the recommended treatments are superior to any other, and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. The use of locally developed and monitored treatment algorithms has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be encouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, some clinics employ combination therapy (e.g., provider- administered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy between visits to the provider). However, limited data exist regarding the efficacy or risk of complications associated with combination therapy.

Factors that influence selection of treatment include wart size, number, anatomic site, and morphology; patient preference, cost of treatment, convenience, adverse effects, and provider experience. Factors that might affect response to therapy include immunosuppression and compliance with therapy. The treatment modality should be changed if thre is no substantial improvement after a complete course of treatment or if side effects are severe. Most anogenital warts respond within 3 months of therapy. The response to treatment and any side effects should be evaluated throughout the course of therapy.

Complications occur rarely when treatment is administered properly. Persistent hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation can occur with ablative modalities (e.g.; cryotherapy, electrocautery) and have been described with immune modulating therapies (e.g.; imiquimod cream). Rarely, treatment can result in chronic pain syndromes (e.g., vulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in the case of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.

Treatment regimens are classified as either patient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-applied modalities are preferred by some persons because they can be administered in the privacy of their home. To ensure that patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should be provided in the clinic and all anogenital warts should be accessible and identified. Follow-up visits after several weeks of therapy enable providers to answer any questions about the use of the medication and address any side effects they have experienced; follow-up visits also facilitate the assessment of the response to treatment.

Imiquimod is a patient-applied topically active immune enhancer that stimulates production of interferon and other cytokines. Imiquimod 5% cream should be applied once at bedtime, three times a week for up to 16 weeks752. Similarly, imiquimod 3.75% cream should be applied once at bedtime, but is applied every night 753. With either formulation, the treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6–10 hours after the application. Local inflammatory reactions, including redness, irritation, induration, ulceration/erosions, and vesicles may occur with the use of imiquimod, and hypopigmentation has also been described754. In a small number of case reports, treatment with imiquimod cream might have been associated with worsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and lichenoid dermatoses 755-757 . There are limited human data on the use of imiquimod in pregnancy, but animal data suggest that it is low risk. 310

Podofilox (podophyllotoxin) is a patient-applied antimitotic drug that causes wart necrosis. Podofilox solution (using a cotton swab) or podofilox gel (using a finger) should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, for up to four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed 10 cm2, and the total volume of podofilox should be limited to 0.5 mL per day. If possible, the health-care provider should apply the initial treatment to demonstrate the proper application technique and identify which warts should be treated. Mild to moderate pain or local irritation might develop after treatment. Podofilox is contraindicated in pregnancy. 310

Sinecatechins is a patient-applied green-tea extract with an active product (catechins). Sinecatechins 15% ointment should be applied three times daily (0.5 cm strand of ointment to each wart) using a finger to ensure coverage with a thin layer of ointment until complete 758- clearance of warts is achieved. This product should not be continued for longer than 16 weeks 760. The medication should not be washed off after use. Sexual (i.e., genital, anal, or oral) contact should be avoided while the ointment is on the skin. The most common side effects of sinecatechins are erythema, pruritus/burning, pain, ulceration, edema, induration, and vesicular rash. The medication is not recommended for persons with HIV infection, other immunocompromised conditions, or with genital herpes because the safety and efficacy of therapy has not been evaluated. The safety of sinecatechins during pregnancy is unknown.

Cryotherapy is a provider-applied therapy that destroys warts by thermal-induced cytolysis. Health-care providers must be trained on the proper use of this therapy because over- and undertreatment can result in complications or low efficacy. Pain during and after application of the liquid nitrogen, followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering, is common. Local anesthesia (topical or injected) might facilitate therapy if warts are present in many areas or if the area of warts is large.

Surgical therapy has the advantage of usually eliminating warts at a single visit, however recurrence can occur. Surgical removal requires substantial clinical training, additional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit. After local anesthesia is applied, visible anogenital warts can be physically destroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional hemostasis is required. Care must be taken to control the depth of electrocautery to prevent scarring. Alternatively, the warts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of fine scissors or a scalpel, by carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, or by curettage. Because most warts are exophytic, this procedure can be accomplished with a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis. Hemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in cases of very minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum chloride solution). Suturing is neither required nor indicated in most cases. In patients with large or extensive warts, surgical therapy, including CO2 laser may be most beneficial. Surgical therapy, including CO2 laser might also be useful for intraurethral warts, particularly for those persons who have not responded to other treatments.

Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) are provider-applied caustic agents that destroy warts by chemical coagulation of proteins. Although these preparations are widely used, they have not been investigated thoroughly. TCA solution has a low viscosity comparable with that of water and can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if applied excessively. A small amount should be applied only to the warts and allowed to dry (i.e. develop white frost on tissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense or an excess amount of acid is applied, the area can be powdered with talc, covered with sodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), or washed with liquid soap preparations to neutralize the acid or remove unreacted acid. TCA/BCA treatment can be repeated weekly if necessary.

#### Alternative Regimens

Alternative regimens have less data on efficacy and might be associated with more side effects, including intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, topical cidofovir, and podophyllin resin. Podopyllin resin is no longer a recommended regimen because of the array of safe and effective regimens available, and because there have been reports of severe systemic toxicity when podophyllin resin was applied to large areas of friable tissue and was not washed off within 4 hours 761-763. Podophyllin resin 10%–25% in compound tincture of benzoin can be considered for provider-administered treatment if strict adherence to the recommendations for application. Podophyllin should be applied to each wart and then allowed to air-dry before the treated area comes into contact with clothing. Over-application or failure to air dry can result in local irritation caused by spread of the compound to adjacent areas and possible systemic toxicity. The treatment can be repeated weekly, if necessary. To avoid the possibility of complications associated with systemic absorption and toxicity: 1) application should be limited to <0.5 mL of podophyllin or an area of <10 cm2 of warts per session 2) the area to which treatment is administered should not contain any open lesions, wounds, or friable tissue, and 3) the preparation should be thoroughly washed off 1–4 hours after application. Podophyllin resin preparations differ in the concentration of active components and contaminants. The shelf-life and stability of podophyllin preparations are unknown.
