### Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although the inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, they can spread to involve the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases, but it occurs more frequently among adolescents and in men without evidence of inflammation or infection. When the onset of pain is sudden, unilateral, and severe, the test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary- tract infection, or diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation of testicular torsion is important because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should raise suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method to diagnose epididymitis, but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be primarily used for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotum swelling. Differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis must be made on the basis of clinical evaluation, when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound. While ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling assoicated with epididymitis, it provides minimal utility for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis; because a negative ultrasound does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound, therefore, should be reserved for men with scrotal pain who cannot be diagnosed accurately by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following point of care tests:

+ Gram, methylene blue or gentian violet (MB or GV) stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥2 WBC per oil immersion field468 .These stains are preferred point of care diagnostic tests for evaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethral inflammation and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBC containing intracellular Gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram’s or MB/GV stain, respectively.
+ Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine
+ Microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment demonstrating ≥10 WBC per high spun power field.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, in the absence of a positive gram, MB or GV stain smear, using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT testing in men. Urine cultures for sexually transmitted chlamydia and gonococcal epididymitis have low diagnostic yield; a negative urine culture does not exclude the presence of these sexually transmitted infections.Urine bacterial culture may have a higher yield in men with sexually transmitted enteric infections or in older men where genitourinary bacteruria is the cause of the acute epididymitis. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for other STDs including HIV.

### Treatment

Presumptive therapy is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available to prevent complications and onward transmission of sexually transmitted infections. The goals of treatment of acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic cure of infection, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) a decrease in potential chlamydia/gonorrhea complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Because presumptive therapy is often initiated before laboratory tests are available, men at risk for sexually transmitted chlamydia and gonorrhea should receive ceftriaxone plus doxycycline for the initial therapy of epididymitis. For men who are at risk for bothsexually transmitted chlamydia, gonorrhea, and enteric organisms (e.g., men who report insertive anal intercourse), ceftriaxone and levofloxacin or ofloxacin are recommended. Therapy including levofloxacin or ofloxacin should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms and gonorrhea has been ruled out by gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Complete resolution of discomfort may take a few weeks after the antibiotic regimen is completed.

Although most men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an out-patient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever suggests other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, etc) or when men are unable or unlikely to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Because high fever is uncommon and indicates a complicated infection, these patients should be admitted for further evaluation.

Men who have acute epididymitis that is confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advise to abstain from sexual intercourse til they and their partners have completed treatment (i.e.; until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved).
