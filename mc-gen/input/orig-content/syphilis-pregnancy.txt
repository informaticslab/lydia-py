### Diagnostic Considerations

Seropositive pregnant women should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is documented clearly in the medical records and sequential serologic antibody titers have declined appropriately for the stage of syphilis. In general, the risk of antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the stage of syphilis during pregnancy and the T. pallidum bacteremia with the highest risk at the primary and secondary stage. Quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if it is greater than or equal to 1:8 may be a marker of arly infection and bacteremia. However, risk of fetal infection is still significant in pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers. Stable serofast low antibody titers might not require treatment in previously treated women; however, rising or persistently high antibody titers might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be considered.

If a treponemal EIA or CIA test is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive EIA/CIA tests should be reflexed to a quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL). If the non-treponemal test is negative, then the results are discrepant; and a second treponemal test (TP-PA preferred) should be performed, preferably on the same specimen.

1. If the second treponemal test is positive, then current or past syphilis infection is confirmed. For women with a history of adequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no further treatment is necessary. Women without a prior history of treatment should be staged and treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.
2. If the second treponemal test is negative, then the positive EIA/CIA is more likely to be a false positive test result391. If the woman is at low risk for syphilis, without signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, her partner is without clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis and follow up is likely, then repeat serologic testing within 4 weeks can be considered to see if the EIA/CIA remains positive or if the the RPR/VDRL or the TP- PA becomes positive. Otherwise treat according to the stage of syphilis. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, then no further treatment is necessary.

### Treatment

Penicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and for treating fetal infection 433. Evidence is insufficient to determine optimal, recommended penicillin regimens 434.
