<h3>Initial Examination</h3>
<p>Decisions to perform these tests should be made on an individual basis. An initial examination might include the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae at the sites of penetration or attempted penetration385. These tests are preferred for the diagnostic evaluation of adolescent or adult sexual assault survivors.</li>
<li>NAATs or point-of-care testing (i.e. DNA probes) for T.vaginalis. Point-of-care testing and/or wet mount with measurement of vaginal pH and KOH application for the whiff test should be done for evidence of BV and candidiasis, especially if vaginal discharge, malodor, or itching is evident.</li>
<li>A serum sample for immediate evaluation for HIV infection, hepatitis B, and syphilis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow-Up Examinations</h3>
<p>After the initial postassault examination, follow-up examinations provide an opportunity to 1) detect new infections acquired during or after the assault; 2) complete hepatitis B and human papilloma virus vaccinations, if indicated; 3) complete counseling and treatment for other STDs; and 4) monitor side effects and adherence to postexposure prophylactic medication, if prescribed.</p>
<p>If initial testing was done, follow-up examination should be conducted within 1 week to ensure that results of positive tests can be discussed promptly with the survivor, that treatment is provided if not given at the initial visit, and that any follow-up for the infection(s) can be arranged. If initial tests are negative and treatment was not provided, examination for STDs can be repeated within 1– 2 weeks of the assault because infectious agents acquired through assault might not have produced sufficient concentrations of organisms to result in positive test results at the initial examination. If treatment was initially provided (with or without testing), testing should be conducted after treatment only if the survivor reports having symptoms. A follow-up examination at 1-2 months should also be considered to reevaluate for development of anogenital warts, especially among sexual assault survivors diagnosed with other STDs. Serologic tests for HIV and syphilis can be repeated at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months using methods to identify acute HIV infection and at one and three months for syphilis after the assault if intial test results were negative and infection in the assailant could not be ruled out (see Sexual Assault and STDs, Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection).</p>
<h3>Prophylaxis</h3>
<p>Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault843,844. As a result, the following routine prophylactic therapy after a sexual assault is recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas.</li>
<li>Emergency contraception. This measure should be considered when the assault could result in pregnancy in the survivor.</li>
<li>Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination, without HBIG, if the hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown. If the assailant is known to be HBsAg-positive, unvaccinated survivors should receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The vaccine and HBIG if indicated, should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1–2 and 4–6 months after the first dose (see hepatitis B).</li>
<li>Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for female survivors aged 9 through 26 years and male survivors aged 9 through 21 years or through 26 years if MSM contact with no previous HPV vaccinations or an incomplete series is recommended. The vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination and follow-up dose at 1–2 months and 6 months after the first dose.</li>
<li>HIV PEP is individualized according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection and Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment for PEP)</li>

<p>If alchohol has been recently ingested or emergency contraception is provided, metronidazole or tinidazole can be taken by the sexual assault survivor at home rather than as directly observed therapy to minimize potential side effects and drug interactions. For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific agent. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. Clinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination.</p>
