The predominant symptom of scabies is pruritus. Sensitization to Sarcoptes scabiei occurs before pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with S. scabiei, sensitization takes up to several weeks to develop. However, pruritus might occur within 24 hours after a subsequent reinfestation. Scabies in adults frequently is sexually acquired, although scabies in children usually is not 833,834.

Lindane is recommended as an alternative therapy because of toxicity832. It should only be835- used if the patient cannot tolerate the recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed 837Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or shower, and it should not be used by persons who have extensive dermatitis, or children aged <2 years. Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States. Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported.

Permethrin is effective and safe and less expensive than ivermectin838. One study demonstrated increased mortality among elderly, debilitated persons who received ivermectin, but this observation has not been confirmed in subsequent reports839. Ivermectin has limited ovivcidal activity and may not prevent recurrances of eggs at the time of treatment, therefore a second dose of ivermectin should be administered 14 days after the first dose. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased and thus the penetration of the drug into the epidermis increases. Adjustment of ivermectin is not required in patients with renal impairment but the safety of multiple doses in patients with severe liver disease is not known.
