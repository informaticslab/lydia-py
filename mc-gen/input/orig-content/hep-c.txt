### Diagnosis and Treatment

HCV testing is recommended by CDC and USPSTF for all persons born during 1945-1965 and others based on their risk for infection or on a recognized exposure, including past or current injection drug use, receiving a blood transfusion before 1992, long-term hemodialysis, being born to a mother with HCV infection, , intranasal drug use, receipt of an unregulated tattoo, and other percutaneous exposures 110,237 217(see Hepatitis C, Prevention). Testing for HCV infection should include the use of an FDA-cleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or enhanced chemiluminescence imunoassay and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody test) followed by HCV RNA testing for those with a positive antibody result238.

Persons determined to be anti-HCV positive should be evaluated (by referral or consultation, if appropriate) for the presence of active infection, presence or development of CLD, and possible treatment. Nucleic acid testing, including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to detect HCV RNA, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of current HCV infection, and an elevated ALT level is biochemical evidence of CLD. Providers should consult with specialists knowledgeable about management of hepatitis C infection and refer to existing guidelines that reflect the latest advances in the management of hepatitis C (www.hcvguidelines.org).
