In the only published study of the treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis among adults, all 12 study participants responded to a single 1-g IM injection of ceftriaxone 571. Because gonococcal conjunctivitis is uncommon, and data on treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis in adults is limited, consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be considered.

Consider lavage of the infected eye with saline solution once.
