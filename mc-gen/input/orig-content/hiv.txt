### Establishing the Diagnosis of HIV Infection

HIV infection can be diagnosed by serologic tests that detect antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 and by virologic tests that can detect HIV antigens or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Testing begins with a sensitive screening test, usually an antigen/antibody combination or antibody immunoassay (IA). Currently available serologic tests are both highly sensitive and specific and can detect all known subtypes of HIV-1. Most can also detect HIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and group N). Rapid HIV tests enable clinicians to make a preliminary diagnosis of HIV infection within half an hour. However, most rapid antibody assays become reactive later than conventional laboratory-based antibody or combination antigen/antibody serologic assays, and thus produce negative results in recently infection persons.

The recommended diagnostic algorithm for HIV infection consists of performing a laboratory-based immunoassay, which if repeatedly reactive is followed by a supplemental test such as an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, Western blot, or indirect immunofluorescence assay. However, currently available FDA-cleared HIV laboratory antigen/antibody immunoassay detect HIV infection earlier than the assays traditionally used as HIV supplemental tests, such as Western blots. Therefore, during very early HIV infection, discordant HIV test results (reactive immunoassay results and negative supplemental test results) have been erroneously interpreted as negative. 294 The recommended algorithm minimizes this problem begins with a combination HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) combination immunoassay, which if reactive, is followed by an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay 295 . This algorithm confers an additional advantage by testing all specimens reactive on the initial immunoassay for HIV-2 antibodies. RNA testing is performed on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative supplemental antibody test results to determine if the discordance represents acute HIV infection. Although HIV-2 is uncommon in the United States, accurate identification is important because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from that for HIV-1 296

The following are specific recommendations that apply to testing for HIV infection:

#### Key Considerations When Establishing An HIV Diagnosis

+ HIV screening is recommended for all persons who seek evaluation or treatment for STDs.
+ HIV testing must be voluntary and free from coercion. Patients must not be tested without their knowledge.
+ Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV test will be performed, unless the patient declines) is recommended in all health-care settings.
+ Specific signed consent for HIV testing should not be required. General informed consent for medical care is considered sufficient to encompass informed consent for HIV testing.
+ Use of Ag/Ab combination tests is encouraged unless persons are unlikely to receive their HIV test results.
+ Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV infection must be followed by additional testing to definitively establish the diagnosis.
+ Providers should be alert to the possibility of acute HIV infection and perform an antigen/antibody immunoassay or HIV RNA in conjunction with an antibody test. Persons suspected of recently acquired HIV infection should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical care provider.

### Acute HIV Infection

Health-care providers should be knowledgeable about the symptoms and signs of acute retroviral syndrome, which develops in 50%â€“90% of persons within the first few weeks after they become infected with HIV289. Acute retroviral syndrome is characterized by non-specific symptoms, including fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. Suspicion of acute retroviral syndrome should prompt urgent assessment with an antigen/antibody IA or HIV RNA in conjunction with an antibody test. If IA are negative or indeterminate then testing for HIV RNA should follow. Clinicians should not assume that a laboratory report of a negative HIV antibody test result indicates that the necessary RNA screening for acute HIV infection has been conducted. Available HIV home kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore will not detect acute HIV infection.

Persons with acute HIV infection are highly infectious during this stage of infection because the concentration of virus in plasma and genital secretions is extremely elevated 285,297. Antiretroviral therapy during acute HIV infection is recommended because it substantially reduces infectiousness to others, improves laboratory markers of disease, may decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral set-point, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and preserves immune function 66. Persons diagnosed with acute HIV infection should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical-care provider, provided prevention counseling (e.g., reduce number of partners, use condoms correctly and consistently), and screened for STDs. Information should be provided on the availability of post- exposure prophylaxis for sexual and needle-sharing partners not known to have HIV infection if the most recent contact was within the 72 hours preceding HIV diagnosis (www.cdc.gov/hiv)
