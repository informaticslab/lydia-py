### Treatment

Several antimicrobial regimens have been effective, but only a limited number of controlled trials have been published376. Treatment has been shown to halt progression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward from the ulcer margins; prolonged therapy is usually required to permit granulation and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse can occur 6â€“18 months after apparently effective therapy.

The addition of another antibiotic to these regimens can be considered if improvement is not evident within the first few days of therapy. Aminoglycoside treatment is an option (gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours).
