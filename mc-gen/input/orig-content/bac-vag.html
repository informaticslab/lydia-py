<h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>BV can be diagnosed by the use of clinical criteria (i.e., Amsel’s Diagnostic Criteria)<sup id="fnref:597"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:597" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or Gram stain. A Gram stain (considered the gold standard laboratory method for diagnosing BV) is used to determine the relative concentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long Gram-positive rods), Gram-negative and Gram-variable rods and cocci (i.e., G. vaginalis, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and peptostreptococci), and curved Gram-negative rods (i.e., Mobiluncus) characteristic of BV. Clinical criteria require three of the following symptoms or signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>homogeneous, thin, white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls;</li>
<li>presence of clue cells  (e.g., vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent coccoobacilli) on microscopic examination;</li>
<li>pH of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5; or</li>
<li>a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (i.e., the whiff test).</li>
</ul>
<p>Detection of three of these criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain<sup id="fnref:598"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:598" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Other tests, including Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), a DNA hybridization probe test for high concentrations of G. vaginalis, and the OSOM BV Blue test (Sekisui Diagnostics, Framingham, MA), which detects vaginal fluid sialidase activity,  have acceptable performance characteristics compared with Gram stain. Although a prolineaminopeptidase card test is available for the detection of elevated pH and trimethylamine, it has low sensitivity and specificity and therefore is not recommended. PCR has been used in research settings for the detection of a variety of organisms associated with BV, but evaluation of its clinical utility is still underway. Detection of specific organisms might be predictive of BV by PCR <sup id="fnref:599"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:599" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:600"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:600" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. Additional validation is needed before these tests can be recommended to diagnose BV. Culture of G. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool because it is not specific. Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for the diagnosis of BV because of their low sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment is recommended for women with symptoms. The established benefits of therapy in nonpregnant women are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection. Other potential benefits to treatment include reduction in the risk for acquiring C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, HIV, and herpes simplex type 2 <sup id="fnref:601"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:601" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:593"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:593" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:594"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:594" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is advised to avoid consuming alcohol during treatment with nitroimidazoles.  To reduce the possibility of a disulfiram-like reaction, abstinence from alcohol use should continue for 24 hours after completion of metronidazole. Clindamycin cream is oil-based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms for 5 days after use (refer to clindamycin product labeling for additional information).</p>
<p>Women should be advised to refrain from sexual activity or use condoms consistently and correctly during the treatment regimen. Douching might increase the risk for relapse, and no data support the use of douching for treatment or relief of symptoms. </p>
<p>It is advised to avoid consuming alcohol during treatment with nitroimidazoles.  To reduce the possibility of a disulfiram-like reaction, abstinence from alcohol use should continue for 72 hours after completion of tinidazole.</p>
<p>Alternative regimens include several tinidazole regimens<sup id="fnref:602"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:602" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> or clindamycin (oral or intravaginal)<sup id="fnref:603"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:603" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.  An additional regimen includes metronidazole (750-mg extended release tablets orally once daily for 7 days), however data on the performance of this alternative regimen are limited. </p>
<p>Several studies have evaluated the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of using intravaginal lactobacillus formulations to treat BV and restore normal flora. <sup id="fnref:604"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:604" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:605"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:605" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:606"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:606" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:607"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:607" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:608"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:608" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> Overall, no studies support the addition of any available lactobacillus formulations or probiotic as an adjunctive or replacement therapy in women with BV. Further research efforts to determine the role of these regimens in BV treatment and prevention are ongoing.</p>
