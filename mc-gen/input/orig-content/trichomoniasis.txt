#### Diagnostic Considerations

The use of highly sensitive and specific tests is recommended for detecting T. vaginalis. Among women, NAAT is highly sensitive, often detecting three to five times more T. vaginalis infections than wet-mount microscopy, a method associated with poor sensitivity (51%-65%).  664,665  The APTIMA T. vaginalis assay (Hologic Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) is FDA-cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from vaginal, endocervical, or urine specimens from women. This assay detects RNA by transcription-mediated amplification with a clinical sensitivity of 95.3%–100% and specificity of 95.2%-100%666 667. Among women, vaginal swab and urine have up to 100% concordance664. As analyte-specific reagents, this assay can be used with urine or urethral swabs from men if validated per CLIA regulations. The sale, distribution, and use of analyte specific reagents are covered under 21 C.F.R. 809.30 pertaining to in vitro diagnostic products for human use. For T. vaginalis diagnosis in men, the sensitivity of self-collected penile-meatal swabs was higher than that of urine in one study (80% and 39%, respectively)668.  The BD Probe Tec TV Qx Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) is FDA-cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from endocervical, vaginal, or urine specimens from women. Although it may be feasible to perform these NAATs on the same specimen used for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening tests, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis is distinct and should not be overlooked in older adults.

Other FDA-cleared tests to detect T. vaginalis in vaginal secretions include the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Sekisui Diagnostics, Framingham, MA), an antigen-detection test using immunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology and may be performed at the point of care, and the Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), a DNA hybridization probe test that evaluates for T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, and C. albicans. The results of the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test are available in approximately 10 minutes, with sensitivity 82%-95% and specificity 97%–100%  667,669.Self-testing may become an option, as a study of 209 young women aged 14–22 years found that >99% could correctly perform and interpret her own self-test using the OSOM assay, with a high correlation with clinician interpretation (96% agreement, κ=0.87) 670. The results of the Affirm VP III are available within 45 minutes. Sensitivity and specificity are 63% and 99.9%, respectively, compared with culture and TMA; sensitivity may be higher among women who are symptomatic671,672. Neither the OSOM nor the Affirm VP III test is FDA-cleared for use with specimens obtained from men. 

Culture was considered the gold standard method for diagnosing T. vaginalis infection before molecular detection methods became available. Culture has a sensitivity of 75%-96% and a specificity of up to 100%476 In women, vaginal secretions are the preferred specimen type for culture, as urine culture is less sensitive476,673,674. In men, culture specimens require a urethral swab, urine sediment, and/or semen. Multiple specimens from men can be used to inoculate a single culture to improve yield. 

The most common method for T. vaginalis diagnosis may be microscopic evaluation of wet preparations of genital secretions, due to convenience and relatively low cost. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of wet mount is low (51%–65%) in vaginal specimens476 667 and lower in specimens from men (e.g., urethral specimens, urine sediment, and semen). Clinicians using wet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately because sensitivity declines as evaluation is delayed, decreasing by up to 20% within 1 hour after collection 675 676. Where highly sensitive (e.g., NAAT) testing on specimens is not feasible, a testing algorithm (e.g., wet mount first, followed by NAAT if negative) can improve diagnostic sensitivity in persons with an initial negative result by wet mount476. Although T. vaginalis may be an incidental finding on a Pap test, neither conventional nor liquid-based Pap tests are considered diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis, because false negatives and false positives can occur. 


#### Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and may reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes in women with HIV is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

It is advised to avoid consuming alcohol during treatment with nitroimidazoles.  To reduce the possibility of a disulfiram-like reaction, abstinence from alcohol use should continue for 24 hours after completion of metronidazole or 72 hours after completion of tinidazole.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobial medications known to be effective against T. vaginalis infections. Of these drugs, metronidazole and tinidazole have been cleared by FDA for the oral or parenteral treatment of trichomoniasis. Tinidazole is generally more expensive, reaches higher levels in the serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects677-679. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%680-682, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%681,683-686. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2 g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole suggest that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and resolution of symptoms687. 

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and pervaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.
