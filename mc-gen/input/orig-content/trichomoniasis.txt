#### Diagnostic Considerations

The use of highly sensitive and specific tests is encouraged for T. vaginalis detection in both women and men. Among women, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) may detect a prevalence three to five times higher than wet mount microscopy, a method with poor sensitivity(51% to 65% ). 646,647 The APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis assay (Hologic Gen- Probe, San Diego, CA) is FDA-cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from vaginal or endocervical specimens or urine from symptomatic or asymptomatic women. This assay detects RNA by transcription-mediated amplification with a clinical sensitivity of 95.3–100% and specificity of 95.2-100% 648 649. Among women, vaginal swab and urine have up to 100% concordance646. As analyte-specific reagents, this assay can be used with urine or urethral swabs from men if validated per CLIA specifications. The sale, distribution and use of analyte specific reagents are covered under 21 C.F.R. 809.30 pertaining to in vitro diagnostic products for human use. For T. vaginalis diagnosis in men, the sensitivity of self-collected penile-meatal swabs was higher than that of urine in one study (80% and 39%, respectively650. The BD Probe Tec TV Qx Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) is FDA-cleared for detection of trichomoniasis from endocervical, vaginal, or urine specimens in women. Although it may be feasible to perform these NAATs on the same specimen used for chlamydia/gonorrhea screening tests, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis is distinct and should not be overlooked in older adults.

Other FDA-cleared tests to detect T vaginalis in vaginal secretions in women include the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Sekisui Diagnostics, Framingham, MA), an antigen-detection test using immunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology that is CLIA-waived and may be performed at the point of care, and the Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), a nucleic acid probe-hybridization test that evaluates for T. vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida albicans. The results of the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test are available in approximately 10 minutes, with sensitivity 82-95% and specificity 97–100% 649,651.Self-testing may be an option, as a study of 209 young women aged 14–22 years found that over 99% could correctly perform and interpret her own self-test using the OSOM assay, with a high correlation with clinician interpretation (96% agreement, κ=0.87) 652. The results of the Affirm VP III are available within 45 minutes, with sensitivity 63% and specificity of 99.9% compared with culture and TMA; sensitivity may be higher among women who are symptomatic653,654.Neither the OSOM nor the Affirm VP III test is FDA-cleared for use with male specimens.

Culture was considered the gold standard method for diagnosing T. vaginalis infection before molecular detection methods became available. Culture has a sensitivity of 75-96% and a specificity of up to 100%465 In women, vaginal secretions are the preferred specimen type for culture, as urine culture is less sensitive465,655,656. In men, culture specimens require a urethral swab, urine, and/or semen. Multiple specimens from men can be used to inoculate a single culture to improve yield.

The most common method for T. vaginalis diagnosis may be microscopic evaluation of wet preparations of genital secretions, due to convenience and relatively low cost. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of wet mount is 51%–65% in vaginal specimens465 649 Clinicians using wet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately since sensitivity declines as evaluation is delayed, decreasing by up to 20% within one hour after collection 657 658. Where highly-sensitive (e.g., NAAT testing on all specimens is not feasible, a testing algorithm may be an option for improving diagnostic sensitivity in persons with an initial negative result by wet mount465. Although T. vaginalis may be an incidental finding on a Pap test, neither conventional nor liquid- based Pap tests are considered diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis since false negatives and false positives can occur.

It is unclear whether the rectum can be a reservoir for T. vaginalis infection, or whether this occasional finding might reflect recent depositing/contamination in up to 5% of individuals reporting recent receptive anal sex659,660 . Furthermore, efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of rectal screening are unknown, so rectal testing for T vaginalis is not recommended. Similarly, oral testing for T. vaginalis is not recommended due to a lack of evidence for oral infections. T. vaginalis infection is not a nationally notifiable condition in the United States119,661 .

#### Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T vaginalis infection and may reduce transmission; associated adverse outcomes in women with HIV are also reduced. 

It is advised to avoid consuming alcohol during treatment with nitroimidazoles. Abstinence from alcohol use should continue for 24 hours after completion of metronidazole or 72 hours after completion of tinidazole, to reduce the possibility of a disulfiram-like reaction.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobial medications known to be effective against T. vaginalis infections. Of these drugs, metronidazole and tinidazole are available in the United States and are cleared by the FDA for the oral or parenteral treatment of trichomoniasis. Tinidazole is generally more expensive, reaches higher levels in the serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects662-664. In randomized clinical trials, the recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84–98%665-667, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92–100%666,668-671. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2 g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole suggest that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and resolution of symptoms672.

Metronidazole gel is not recommended because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, likely because the gel doe not achieve therapeutic levels in the urethra and pervaginal glands.

Providers should advise persons infected with T vaginalis to abstain from unprotected sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e., when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STDs including HIV should be performed in persons with T vaginalis.
