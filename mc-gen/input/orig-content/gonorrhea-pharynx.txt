Most gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common in some populations 496,497,566,567. Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than infections at urogenital and anorectal sites 551. Few antimicrobial regimens, including those involving oral cephalosporins, can reliably cure >90% of gonococcal pharyngeal infections 559,560. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonococcal about oral sexual exposure; if reported, patients should be treated with a regimen with acceptable efficacy against pharyngeal gonorrhea infection.
