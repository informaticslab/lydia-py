### Diagnostic Considerations

Sensitive and specific methods used to diagnose chlamydial ophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and nonculture tests (e.g., direct fluorescence antibody [DFA] tests, EIA, and NAAT). DFA is the only nonculture FDA-cleared test for the detection of chlamydia from conjunctival swabs; NAATs are not FDA-cleared for the detection of chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical laboratories must verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations. Specimens for culture isolation and nonculture tests should be obtained from the everted eyelid using a dacron-tipped swab or the swab specified by the manufacturerâ€™s test kit, and (for culture and DFA) they must contain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone. Ocular specimens from neonates being evaluated for chlamydial conjunctivitis also should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae. (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum caused by N. gonnorrhoeae).

Data on the use of azithromycin for the treatment of neonatal chlamydia infection is limited but a short course of therapy, might be effective 522. Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for treatment for opthalmia neonatorum caused by chlamydia and is unnecessary when systemic treatment is administered.
