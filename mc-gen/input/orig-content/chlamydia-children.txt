Sexual abuse must be considered a cause of chlamydial infection in infants and children. However, perinatally transmitted C. trachomatis infection of the nasopharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum might persist for 2-3 years (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

### Diagnostic Considerations

NAAT can be used for vaginal and urine specimens from girls (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children), although data are insufficient to recommend the use of NAAT in boys. Data also are lacking regarding use of NAAT for specimens from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in boys and girls395; other nonculture tests (e.g., DFA) are not recommended because of specificity concerns. Culture is still the preferred method for detection of  urogenital C. trachomatis in boys and at extragenital sites in boys and girls.
