Sexual abuse must be considered a cause of chlamydial infection in preadolescent children, although perinatally transmitted C. trachomatis infection of the nasopharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum might persist for >1 year (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

### Diagnostic Considerations

NAATs can be used for vaginal and urine specimens from girls (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children), however there are insufficient data to recommend the use of NAATs for use in boys and extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in boys and girls384. Culture is still the preferred method for detection of C. trachomatis at those sites. Other nonculture tests such as the DFA are not recommended because of specificity concerns.
