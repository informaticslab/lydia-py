### Diagnostic Considerations

C. trachomatis urogenital infection in women can be diagnosed by testing first catch urine or by collecting swab specimens from the endocervix or vagina. Diagnosis of C. trachomatis urethral infection in men can be made by testing a urethral swab or first catch urine specimen. NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended tests for C. trachomatis detection384. NAATs that are FDA-cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens, can be collected by a provider or self-collected by a patient. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs492,493 and women find this screening strategy highly acceptable 494,495. Based on ease of collection and having C. trachomatis detection rates comparable to other specimens, optimal urogenital specimen types for chlamydia screening using NAATs include first catch urine from men and vaginal swabs from women. Rectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection in persons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be diagnosed by testing at the anatomic site of exposure. The clinical significance of oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection is unclear and thus routine oropharyngeal screeing for CT is not recommended (see MSM). NAATs are not FDA- cleared for use with rectal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. However, NAATs have been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and specificity compared with culture for the detection of C. trachomatis at rectal sites 496-498 and at oropharyngeal sites among men 496-499. Some laboratories have established performance specifications when evaluating rectal and oropharyngeal swab specimens for C. trachomatis to meet CLIA regulatory requirements as applicable prior to reporting results for clinical management. There is good evidence that performance of NAATs on self-collected rectal swabs is comparable to clinician-collected rectal swabs, and patients find this specimen collection strategy for rectal C. trachomatis screening highly acceptable500-502. Self-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable alternative to clinician- collected rectal swabs for C. trachomatis screening by NAATs, especially when rectal exam is not feasible or when patients prefer self collection over clinician collection. Previous evidence suggests that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for Pap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT testing, although test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than those resulting from the use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens503; regardless, certain NAATs have been FDA-cleared for use on liquid-based cytology specimens.

### Treatment

Treatment prevents adverse reproductive health complications and sexual transmission of C trachomatis, and treating sex partners for chlamydia can prevent reinfection of the index patient and infection of other partners. Treating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of C. trachomatis to infants during birth. Chlamydia treatment should be provided promptly for all persons testing positive for infection; delays in receiving chlamydia treatment have been associated with complications (e.g., PID) in a limited proportion of chlamydia-infected women 504. The following recommended treatment regimens and alternative regimens cure infection and usually relieve symptoms.

A meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital chlamydial infection demonstrated that the treatments were equally efficacious, with microbial cure rates of 97% and 98%, respectively 505. These studies were conducted primarily in populations with urethral and cervical infection in which follow-up was encouraged, adherence to a 7-day regimen was effective, and culture or EIA (rather than the more sensitive NAAT) was used for determining microbiological outcome. More recent retrospective studies have raised concern about the efficacy of azithromycin for rectal C. trachomatis infection506,507, however these studies have limitations and prospective clinical trials comparing azithromycin versus doxycycline regimens for rectal C. trachomatis infection are needed. On-site, directly observed therapy with azithromycin should always be available to treat patients for whom adherence with multiday dosing is a concern. Most persons with C. trachomatis detected at oropharyngeal sites do not have oropharyngeal symptoms. The clinical significance of C. trachomatis detected at oropharyngeal sites is unclear, therefore routine C. trachomatis screening at oropharyngeal sites is not recommended. However, when gonorrhea testing is performed at the oropharyngeal site, chlamydia test results are often reported as well due to dual platform NAAT testing.Available evidence suggests oropharyngeal C. trachomatis can be sexually transmitted to genital sites 508,509, therefore detection of C. trachomatis from an oropharyngeal specimen should be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline. The efficacy of alternative antimicrobial regimens in resolving oropharyngeal chlamydia remains unknown.

In persons who have erratic health-care–seeking and follow-up behavior, or poor treatment adherence, azithromycin might be more cost-effective in treating chlamydia because it enables the provision of a single-dose of directly observed therapy505. In a double-blinded randomized control trial, a doxycycline delayed-release 200 mg tablet administered daily for 7 days was as effective as generic doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treatment of urogenital C. trachomatis infection in men and women and had a lower frequency of gastrointestinal side effects, but is more costly 510. Delayed-release doxycycline (Doryx ®) 200 mg daily for 7 days may be an alternative regimen to the doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treatment of urogenital C. trachomatis infection. Erythromycin might be less efficacious than either azithromycin or doxycycline, mainly because of the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects that can lead to nonadherence with treatment. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin are effective treatment alternatives but are more expensive and offer no advantage in the dosage regimen. Other quinolones either are not reliably effective against chlamydial infection or have not been evaluated adequately.

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies, medications for chlamydial infections should be dispensed on site, and the first dose should be directly observed. To minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen. To minimize the risk for reinfection, patients also should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners are treated.
