As dual therapy, ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together on the same day, preferably simultaneously and under direct observation. Ceftriaxone in a single injection of 250 mg provides sustained, high bactericidal levels in the blood. Extensive clinical experience indicates that ceftriaxone is safe and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites, curing 99.2% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal and 98.9% of pharyngeal infections in older clinical trials559,560. There are no clinical data to support use of doses of ceftriaxone >250 mg.

Single-dose injectible cephalosporin regimens (other than ceftriaxone 250 mg IM) that are safe and generally effective against uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections include ceftizoxime (500 mg IM), cefoxitin (2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally), and cefotaxime (500 mg IM). None of the injectible cephalosporins offer any advantage over ceftriaxone for urogenital infection, and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain 559,560.

Several other antimicrobials are active against N. gonorrhoeae, but none have substantial advantages over the recommended regimen, and they should not be used if pharyngeal infection is suspected. A 400-mg oral dose of cefixime should be considered as an alternative cephalosporin regimen because it does not provide as high, nor as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as a 250-mg dose of ceftriaxone, and demonstrates limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea 559,560. The increase in the prevalence of US GISP isolates with elevated cefixime MICs might indicate early stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal resistance to cephalosporins. CDC anticipates that rising cefixime MICs soon will result in declining effectiveness of cefixime for the treatment of urogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes less effective, continued used of cefixime might hasten the development of resistance to ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, injectable cephalosporin and the last antimicrobial that is known to be highly effective in a single dose for treatment of gonorrhea at all anatomic sites of infection. Other oral cephalosporins such as cefpodoxime or cefuroxime are not recommended because of inferior efficacy and less favorable pharmacodynamics.

Because of the high prevalence of tetracycline resistance among GISP isolates, particularly those with elevated cefixime MICs, the use of azithromycin as the second antimicrobial is preferred. However, when there is an allergy to azithromycin, doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) can be used as an alternative second antimicrobial in place of azithromycin when used in combination with cefixime.

A recent clinical trial demonstrated that dual treatment with single doses of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g, or dual treatment with single doses of intramuscular gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g, are effective regimens for uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea, with cure rates of 99.5% (lower one-sided 95% CI bound = 97.6%) and 100% (lower one-sided 95% CI bound = 98.5%), respectively561 . This trial was not powered to provide reliable estimates of the efficacy of these regimens for treatment of rectal or pharyngeal infection, but both regimens cured the few extra-genital infections among study participants. Either of these regimens may be considered as alternative treatment options in the setting of a cephalosporin allergy. However, gastrointestinal adverse events may limit their use: 7.7% of patients treated with gemifloxacin plus azithromycin and 3.3% of patients treated with gentamicin plus azithromycin vomited within 1 hour and required retreatment with a ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

Monotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose has been demonstrated to be effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea (99.2% efficacy; 95% CI = 97.3%â€“99.9%) 560. However, monotherapy is no longer recommended because of, concerns over the ease with which N. gonorrhoeae can develop resistance to macrolides and because several studies have documented azithromycin treatment failures 562 541,563-565. N. gonorrhoeae in the United States is not adequately susceptible to penicillins, tetracyclines, and older macrolides (e.g., erythromycin) for these antimicrobials to be recommended.
