### Diagnostic Considerations

NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have many infectious etiologies. NGU is confirmed in symptomatic men when staining of urethral secretions indicates inflammation without Gram negative or purple diplococci. All men who have confirmed NGU should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea even if point-of-care tests are negative for evidence of GC. NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhea are recommended because of the high sensitivity and specificity and a specific diagnosis might reduce complications, re-infection and onward transmission. T. vaginalis testing could be considered in areas or populations of high prevalence.

### Treatment

Presumptive treatment should be initiated at the time of NGU diagnosis. Azithromycin and doxycycline are highly effective for chlamydial urethritis. NGU associated with M. genitalium respond better to azithromycin than doxycycline, however azithromycin efficacy may be declining (See, Mycoplasma genitalium). Single-dose regimens have the advantage of improved compliance and directly observed treatment. To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site in the clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed.

To minimize onward transmission and reinfection, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partner(s) have been adequately treated (i.e.; for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen, and symptoms have resolved.

Men diagnosed with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.
