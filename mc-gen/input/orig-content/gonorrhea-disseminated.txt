Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) frequently results in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetrical polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, or oligoarticular septic arthritis 572. The infection is complicated occasionally by perihepatitis and rarely by endocarditis or meningitis. Some strains of N. gonorrhoeae that cause DGI can cause minimal genital inflammation. If DGI is suspected, NAAT or culture specimens from urogenital and extragenital sites, as applicable, should be collected and processed in addition to culture specimens from disseminated sites of infections (e.g.; skin, synovial, blood and CNS). All N. gonorrhoeae isolates should be tested for antimicrobial susceptiblity.

Hospitalization and consultation with an infectious disease specialist are recommended for initial therapy, especially for patients who might not comply with treatment, for those in whom diagnosis is uncertain, and for those who have purulent synovial effusions or other complications. Examination for clinical evidence of endocarditis and meningitis should be performed.

No recent studies have been published on the treatment of DGI. The duration of treatment of DGI has not been systematically studied, and treatment of DGI should be undertaken in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.Treatment for DGI should be guided by the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Pending antimicrobial susceptibility results, treatment with one of the recommended regimens should be based on the clinical presentation. When treating for the arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, the provider can switch to another oral agent guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing 24-28 hours after substantial clinical improvement for a total course of at least seven days. Therapy for meningitis should be continued with recommended parenteral therapy for 10â€“14 days. Parenteral antimicrobial therapy for endocarditis should be continued for at least 4 weeks.
