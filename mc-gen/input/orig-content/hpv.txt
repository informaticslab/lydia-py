### Diagnostic Considerations 

#### HPV Tests

HPV tests are available to detect oncogenic types of HPV infection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening and management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or histology (see Cervical Cancer, Screening Recommendations).  These tests should not be used for male partners of women with HPV, women aged <25 years, for diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STD test. 

### Treatment

Treatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) or pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV.  Subclinical genital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously, and therefore specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV infection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer, Screening Recommendations); HPV-related precancer should be managed based on existing guidance.
