 Alternative Oral Regimens
</h4>
<p>
 Although information regarding other outpatient regimens is limited, other regimens have undergone at least one clinical trial and have demonstrated broad spectrum coverage. In a single clinical trial, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline were effective together in obtaining short-term clinical response (394); however, gastrointestinal symptoms might limit compliance&nbsp;with this regimen. Azithromycin has demonstrated short-term effectiveness in one randomized trial (395), and in another study, it was effective when used combination with ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose and azithromycin 1 g orally once a week for 2 weeks (396). When considering alternative regimens, the addition of metronidazole should be considered because anaerobic organisms are suspected in the etiology of PID and metronidazole will also treat BV.

 As a result of the emergence of quinolone-resistant
 <i>
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 , regimens that include a quinolone agent are no longer recommended for the treatment of PID. If parenteral cephalosporin therapy is not feasible, use of fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily or ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily for 14 days) with or without metronidazole (500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days) can be considered if the community prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea are low. Diagnostic tests for gonorrhea must be performed before instituting therapy and the patient managed as follows if the test is positive.

 &bull; If the culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility.

 &bull; If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant

 (QRNG) or if antimicrobial susceptibility&nbsp;cannot be assessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), parenteral cephalosporin is recommended. However, if cephalosporin therapy is not feasible, the addition of azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose to a quinolone-based PID regimen is recommended.
