 Nonalbicans VVC
</h4>
<p>
 The optimal treatment of nonalbicans VVC remains unknown. Options include longer duration of therapy (7&ndash;14&nbsp;days) with a nonfluconazole azole drug (oral or topical) as first-line therapy. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule is recommended, administered vaginally once daily for 2 weeks. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70% (380). If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.
