 Maintenance Regimens
</h5>
<p>
 Oral fluconazole (i.e., 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the first line of treatment. If this regimen&nbsp;is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently as a maintenance regimen can be considered.

 Suppressive maintenance antifungal therapies are effective in reducing RVVC. However, 30%&ndash;50% of women will have recurrent disease after maintenance therapy is discontinued. Routine treatment of sex partners is controversial.

  C. albicans

 azole resistance is rare in vaginal isolates, and susceptibility testing is usually not warranted for individual treatment guidance.
