 Diagnosis
</h3>
<p>
 The diagnosis of hepatitis A cannot be made on clinical grounds alone; serologic testing also is required. The presence of IgM antibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A positive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV infection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV infection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the low level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV tests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.
