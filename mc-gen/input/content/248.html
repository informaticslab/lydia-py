 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 Infants at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia are those who do not receive ophthalmia prophylaxis and those whose mothers have had no prenatal care or whose mothers have a history of STDs or substance abuse. Gonococcal ophthalmia&nbsp;is strongly suspected when intracellular gram-negative diplococci are identified in conjunctival exudate, justifying presumptive treatment for gonorrhea after appropriate cultures for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 are obtained. Appropriate chlamydial testing&nbsp;should be done simultaneously. Presumptive treatment for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 might be indicated for newborns who are at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia and who have increased WBCs (but not gonococci) in a Gram-stained smear of conjunctival exudate.

<p>
 In all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis, conjunctival exudates should be cultured for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 and tested for antibiotic susceptibility before a definitive diagnosis is made. A definitive&nbsp;diagnosis is vital because of the public health and social consequences of a diagnosis of gonorrhea. Nongonococcal causes of neonatal ophthalmia include
 <i>
  Moraxella catarrhalis
 </i>
 and other
 <i>
  Neisseria
 </i>
 species, organisms that are indistinguishable&nbsp;from
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 on Gram-stained smear but can be differentiated in the microbiology laboratory.

 Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate and is unnecessary&nbsp;if systemic treatment is administered.
