 Diagnostic Considerations
</h3>
<p>
 Because of the legal implications of a diagnosis of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 infection in a child, culture remains the preferred&nbsp;method for diagnosis. Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exlude gonorrhea. NAATs for the detection&nbsp;of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 can be used under certain circumstances (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children)
