 Diagnostic Considerations
</h3>
<p>
 Nonculture, nonamplified probe tests for chlamydia (EIA and DFA) should not be used because of the possibility of false-positive test results. With respiratory-tract specimens, false-positive results can occur because of cross-reaction of test reagents with
 <i>
  C. pneumoniae
 </i>
 ; with genital and anal specimens,&nbsp;false-positive results might occur as a result of cross-reaction with fecal flora.
