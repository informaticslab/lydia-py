 HPV Tests
</h2>
<p>
 HPV tests are available for women aged &gt;30 years undergoing&nbsp;cervical cancer screening. These tests should not be used for men, for women &lt;20 years of age, or as a general test for STDs. These HPV tests detect viral nucleic acid (i.e., DNA or RNA) or capsid protein. Four tests have been approved by the FDA for use in the United States: the HC II High-Risk HPV test (Qiagen), HC II Low-Risk HPV test (Qiagen), Cervista HPV 16/18 test, and Cervista HPV High-Risk test (Hologics).
