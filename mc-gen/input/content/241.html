 Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)
</h3>
<p>
 DGI frequently results in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetrical arthralgia, tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis. The infection is complicated occasionally by perihepatitis and rarely by endocarditis or meningitis. Some strains of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 that cause DGI can cause minimal genital inflammation. No recent studies have been published on the treatment of DGI.
