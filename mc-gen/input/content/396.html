 Initial Examination
</h4>
<p>
 An initial examination might include the following procedures:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; NAATs for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 . These tests are preferred for the diagnostic evaluation of sexual assault victims, regardless of the sites of penetration or attempted penetration (197).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Wet mount and culture or point-of-care testing of a vaginal-swab specimen for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infection. The wet mount also should be examined for evidence of BV and candidiasis, especially if vaginal discharge, malodor, or itching is evident.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; A serum sample for immediate evaluation for HIV infection,&nbsp;hepatitis B, and syphilis. Decisions to perform these tests should be made on an individual basis.
