 Diagnostic Considerations

 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 urogenital infection in women can be diagnosed by testing urine or by collecting swab specimens from the endocervix or vagina. Diagnosis of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 urethral infection in men can be made by testing a urethral swab or urine specimen. Rectal
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infections in persons that engage in receptive anal intercourse can be diagnosed by testing a rectal swab specimen. NAATs, cell culture, direct immunofluorescence, EIA, and nucleic acid hybridization tests are available for the detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 on endocervical specimens and urethral swab specimens from men (197). NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and are FDA-cleared for use with urine. Some NAATs are cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens, which can be collected by a provider or self-collected by a patient. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens perform at least as well as with other approved specimens using NAATs (276,277), and women find this screening strategy highly acceptable. Rectal and oropharyngeal
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection in persons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be diagnosed by testing at the anatomic site of exposure. Most tests, including NAAT and nucleic acid hybridization tests, are not FDA-cleared for use with rectal or oropharyngeal swab specimens, and chlamydia culture is not widely available for this purpose. However, NAATs have demonstrated improved&nbsp;sensitivity and specificity compared with culture for the detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 at rectal sites (278&ndash;280) and at oropharyngeal sites among men (278&ndash;281). Some laboratories have met CLIA requirements and have validated NAAT testing on rectal swab specimens for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 . Recent evidence suggests that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for Pap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT testing, although test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than those resulting from the use of cervical swab specimens (282); regardless, certain NAATs have been FDA-cleared for use on liquid-based cytology specimens. Persons who undergo testing and are diagnosed with chlamydia should be tested for other STDs.
