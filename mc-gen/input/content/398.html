 Prophylaxis
</h3>
<p>
 Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault (477,478). As a result, routine preventive therapy after a sexual assault should be encouraged. The following&nbsp;prophylactic regimen is suggested as preventive therapy:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination, without HBIG. This vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination if they have not been previously vaccinated. Follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1&ndash;2 and 4&ndash;6 months after the first dose.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea,&nbsp;and trichomonas.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Emergency contraception. (This measure is necessary only when the assault could result in pregnancy in the survivor.)

 For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific agent. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. Clinicians should counsel patients regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination.
