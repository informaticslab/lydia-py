 Treatment
</h3>
<p>
 Treatment cures infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage, although tissue reaction to the infection can result in&nbsp;scarring. Buboes might require aspiration through intact skin or incision and drainage to prevent the formation of inguinal/ femoral ulcerations. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment.

<p>
 Although clinical data are lacking, azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks is probably effective based on its chlamydial antimicrobial activity. Fluoroquinolone-based treatments might also be effective, but extended treatment intervals are likely required.
