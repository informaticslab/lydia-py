 Treatment
</h4>
<p>
 Short-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and regimens&nbsp;of 1&ndash;3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. The&nbsp;topically applied azole drugs are more effective than nystatin. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%&ndash;90% of patients who complete therapy.

 The creams and suppositories in this regimen are oil-based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients and providers should refer to condom product labeling for further information.

<p>
 Intravaginal preparations of butaconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, and tioconazole are available over-the-counter (OTC). Women whose condition has previously been diagnosed&nbsp;with VVC are not necessarily more capable of diagnosing themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an OTC preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms&nbsp;within 2 months should be evaluated with office-based testing. Unnecessary or inappropriate use of OTC preparations is common and can lead to a delay in the treatment of other&nbsp;vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse clinical outcomes.
