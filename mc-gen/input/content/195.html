 Treatment
</h3>
<p>
 Several factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis or to await the results of diagnostic tests. Treatment with antibiotics for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 should be provided for those women at increased risk for this common STD (e.g., those aged &le;25 years, those with new or multiple sex partners, and those who engage in unprotected sex), especially if follow-up cannot be ensured and if a relatively insensitive diagnostic test is used in place of NAAT. Concurrent therapy for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 is indicated if the prevalence of this infection is &gt;5% (those in younger age groups and those living in certain facilities).
</p>
<p>
 Trichomoniasis and BV should also be treated if detected. For women in whom any component of (or all) presumptive therapy is deferred, the results of sensitive tests for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 (e.g., NAATs) should determine the need for treatment subsequent to the initial evaluation.
