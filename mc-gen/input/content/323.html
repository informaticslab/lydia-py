 Treatment
</h2>
<p>
 The primary reason for treating genital warts is the amelioration&nbsp;of symptoms (including relieving cosmetic concerns) and ultimately, removal of the warts. In most patients, treatment&nbsp;can induce wart-free periods. If left untreated, visible genital warts can resolve on their own, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Available therapies for genital warts likely reduce, but probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether the reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting from treatment&nbsp;reduces future transmission remains unclear. No evidence indicates that the presence of genital warts or their treatment is associated with the development of cervical cancer.
