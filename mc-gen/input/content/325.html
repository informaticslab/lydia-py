<p>
 Intra-anal warts should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Many persons with warts on the anal mucosa also have warts on the rectal mucosa, so persons with anal and/or intra-anal warts might benefit from an inspection of the rectal mucosa by digital examination, standard anoscopy, or high-resolution anoscopy.
