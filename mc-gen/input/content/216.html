 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture tests (e.g., EIA, DFA, and NAAT) can be used, although nonculture tests of nasopharyngeal specimens have a lower sensitivity and specificity than non-culture tests of ocular specimens. DFA is the only FDA-cleared test for the detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 from nasopharyngeal specimens. Tracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis.
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 Because test results for chlamydia often are not available in a timely manner, the decision to provide treatment for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 pneumonia must frequently be based on clinical and radiologic findings. The results of tests for chlamydial infection assist in the management of an infant&rsquo;s illness and can help determine the need for treating the mother and her sex partner(s).
