The predominant symptom of scabies is pruritus. Sensitization to _Sarcoptes scabiei_ occurs before pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with _S. scabiei_, sensitization takes up to several weeks to develop. However, pruritus might occur within 24 hours after a subsequent reinfestation. Scabies in adults frequently is sexually acquired, although scabies in children usually is not [^856]  [^857].

Permethrin is effective, safe, and less expensive than ivermectin [^858]. One study demonstrated increased mortality among elderly, debilitated persons who received ivermectin, but this observation has not been confirmed in subsequent reports [^859]. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity and may not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time of treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be administered 14 days after the first dose. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required in patients with renal impairment, but the safety of multiple doses in patients with severe liver disease is not known.Lindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity [^855]; it should only be used if the patient cannot tolerate the recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed [^860]  [^861]  [^862]. Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or shower, and it should not be used by persons who have extensive dermatitis or children aged <10 years. Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported. Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States.
