Most gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common in some populations [^505]  [^506]  [^575]  [^576]. Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than infections at urogenital and anorectal sites [^551]. Few antimicrobial regimens, including those involving oral cephalosporins, can reliably cure >90% of gonococcal pharyngeal infections [^566]  [^567]. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal GC about oral sexual exposure; if reported, patients should be treated with a regimen with acceptable efficacy against pharyngeal gonorrhea infection.
