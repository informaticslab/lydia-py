## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy

Doxycycline is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human data suggest ofloxacin and levofloxacin present a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy, with a potential for toxicity during breastfeeding; however, data from animal studies raise concerns about cartilage damage to neonates [^317].  Thus, alternative drugs should be used to treat chlamydia in pregnancy. Clinical experience and published studies suggest that azithromycin is safe and effective [^523]  [^524]  [^525]. Test-of-cure to document chlamydial eradication (preferably by NAAT) 3-4 weeks after completion of therapy with the recommended regimens because severe sequelae can occur in mothers and neonates if the infection persists. In addition, all pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be retested 3 months after treatment. Detection of _C. trachomatis_ infection at repeat screening during the third semester is not uncommon in adolescent and young adult women, including in those without _C. trachomatis_ detected at the time of initial prenatal screening [^526]  [^527]. Women aged <25 years and those at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g., those who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection) should be rescreened during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the infant [^108]. 

Because of concerns about chlamydia persistence following exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been demonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin,  is now considered an alternative therapy for _C. trachomatis_ in pregnant women [^528]  [^529]. The frequent gastrointestinal side effects associated with erythromycin can result in nonadherence with these alternative regimens. The lower dose 14-day erythromycin regimens can be considered if gastrointestinal tolerance is a concern. Erythromycin estolate is contraindicated during pregnancy because of drug-related hepatotoxicity.
