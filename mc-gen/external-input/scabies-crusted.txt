Crusted scabies (i.e., Norwegian scabies) is an aggressive infestation that usually occurs in immunodeficient, debilitated, or malnourished persons, including persons receiving systemic or potent topical glucocorticoids, organ transplant recipients, persons with HIV infection or human T-lymphotrophic virus-1-infection, and persons with hematologic malignancies. Crusted scabies is transmitted more easily than scabies [^863]. No controlled therapeutic studies for crusted scabies have been conducted, and the appropriate treatment remains unclear. Substantial treatment failure might occur with a single-dose topical scabicide or with oral ivermectin treatment. Combination treatment is recommended with a topical scabicide, either 5% topical benzyl benzoate or 5% topical permethrin cream (full-body application to be repeated daily for 7 days then 2x weekly until discharge or cure), and treatment with oral ivermectin 200 ug/kg on days 1,2,8,9, and 15. Additional ivermectin treatment on days 22 and 29 might be required for severe cases [^864]. Lindane should be avoided because of the risks for neurotoxicity with heavy applications or denuded skin.
