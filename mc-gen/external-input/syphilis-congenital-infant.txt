### Evaluation and Treatment of Infants and Children with Congenital Syphilis

Infants and children aged â‰¥1 month who are identified as having reactive serologic tests for syphilis should be examined thoroughly and have maternal serology and records reviewed to assess whether they have congenital or acquired syphilis (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis and Latent Syphilis, Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Any infant or child at risk for congenital syphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for HIV infection.

#### Recommended Evaluation

+ CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein
+ CBC, differential, and platelet count
+ Other tests as clinically indicated (e.g., long-bone radiographs, chest radiograph, liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, ophthalmologic examination, neuroimaging, and auditory brain-stem response) 

If the infant or child has no clinical manifestations of congenital syphilis and the evaluation (including the CSF examination) is normal, treatment with up to 3 weekly doses of benzathine penicillin G, 50,000 U/kg IM can be considered. A single dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg IM up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units in a single dose can be considered after the 10-day course of IV aqueous penicillin to provide more comparable duration of treatment in those who have no clinical manifestations and normal CSF. All of the above treatment regimens also would be adequate for children who might have other treponemal infections.
