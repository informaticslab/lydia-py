### Diagnostic Considerations

Vaginal cultures should be obtained from women with complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify unusual species, including nonalbicans species, particularly _Candida glabrata_ (_C. glabrata_ does not form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized on microscopy). Although _C. albicans_ azole resistance is possibly becoming more common in vaginal isolates [^723]  [^724], susceptibility testing is usually not warranted for individual treatment guidance.

#### Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC)

Recurrent Vulvovalginal Candidiasis (RVVC), usually defined as four or more episodes of symptomatic VVC within 1 year, affects a small percentage of women (<5%). The pathogenesis of RVVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with RVVC have no apparent predisposing or underlying conditions. _C. glabrata_ and other nonalbicans _Candida_ species are observed in 10%–20% of women with RVVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these nonalbicans species as against _C. albicans_.

#### Treatment

Each individual episode of RVVC caused by _C. albicans_ responds well to short duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, some specialists recommend a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g., 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [day 1, 4, and 7]) to attempt mycologic remission before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.

Oral fluconazole (i.e., 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the first line maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective in reducing RVVC. However, 30%–50% of women will have recurrent disease after maintenance therapy is discontinued. Symptomatic women who remain culture-positive despite maintenance therapy should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

### Severe VVC

Severe vulvovaginitis (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates in patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

### Nonalbicans VVC

Because at least 50% of women with positive cultures for nonalbicans _Candida_ may be minimally or not symptomatic at all and since successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms in women with non-albicans yeast [^725].  The optimal treatment of non-albicans VVC remains unknown. Options include longer duration of therapy (7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) as first-line therapy. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule is recommended, administered vaginally once daily for 2 weeks. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70% [^726]. If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.
