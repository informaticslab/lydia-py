Sexual abuse must be considered a cause of chlamydial infection in infants and children. However, perinatally transmitted _C. trachomatis_ infection of the nasopharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum might persist for 2-3 years (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

### Diagnostic Considerations

NAAT can be used for vaginal and urine specimens from girls (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children), although data are insufficient to recommend the use of NAAT in boys. Data also are lacking regarding use of NAAT for specimens from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in boys and girls [^394]; other nonculture tests (e.g., DFA) are not recommended because of specificity concerns. Culture is still the preferred method for detection of  urogenital _C. trachomatis_ in boys and at extragenital sites in boys and girls.
