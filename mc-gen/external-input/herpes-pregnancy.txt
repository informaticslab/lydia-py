### Genital Herpes in Pregnancy

Most mothers of newborns who acquire neonatal herpes lack histories of clinically evident genital herpes [^373]  [^374]. The risk for transmission to the neonate from an infected mother is high (30%–50%) among women who acquire genital herpes near the time of delivery and low (<1%) among women with prenatal histories of recurrent herpes or who acquire genital HSV during the first half of pregnancy [^375]  [^376].
Prevention of neonatal herpes depends both on preventing acquisition of genital HSV infection during late pregnancy and avoiding exposure of the neonate to herpetic lesions and viral shedding during delivery. Because the risk for herpes is highest in newborn infants of women who acquire genital HSV during late pregnancy, these women should be managed in consultation with maternal-fetal medicine and infectious-disease specialists.
Women without known genital herpes should be counseled to abstain from vaginal intercourse during the third trimester with partners known or suspected of having genital herpes. In addition, pregnant women without known orolabial herpes should be advised to abstain from receptive oral sex during the third trimester with partners known or suspected to have orolabial herpes. Type-specific serologic tests may be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV infection and guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy. For example, such testing could be offered to women with no history of genital herpes whose sex partner has HSV infection. However, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy to decrease the risk for HSV transmission to pregnant women by infected partners has not been studied. Routine HSV-2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not recommended.
All pregnant women should be asked whether they have a history of genital herpes. At the onset of labor, all women should be questioned carefully about symptoms of genital herpes, including prodromal symptoms, and all women should be examined carefully for herpetic lesions. Women without symptoms or signs of genital herpes or its prodrome can deliver vaginally. Although cesarean delivery does not completely eliminate the risk for HSV transmission to the neonate, women with recurrent genital herpetic lesions at the onset of labor should deliver by cesarean delivery to reduce the risk for neonatal HSV infection.
Many infants are exposed to acyclovir each year, and no adverse effects in the fetus or newborn attributable to the use of this drug during pregnancy have been reported. Acyclovir can be safely used to treat women in all stages of pregnancy, along with those who are breastfeeding [^317]  [^377]. Although data regarding prenatal exposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data from animal trials suggest these drugs also pose a low risk in pregnant women. Acyclovir can be administered orally to pregnant women with first-episode genital herpes or recurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant women with severe HSV infection. Suppressive acyclovir treatment late in pregnancy reduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who have recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of recurrences at term [^378]  [^379]  [^380]. However, such treatment may not protect against transmission to neonates in all cases [^381]. No data support use of antiviral therapy among HSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes.
