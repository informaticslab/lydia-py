### Diagnostic Considerations

_C. trachomatis_ urogenital infection in women can be diagnosed by testing first-catch urine or collecting swab specimens from the endocervix or vagina. Diagnosis of _C. trachomatis_ urethral infection in men can be made by testing a urethral swab or first-catch urine specimen. NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and therefore are recommended for detecting _C. trachomatis_ infection [^394]. NAATs that are FDA-cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be collected by a provider or self-collected by a woman in a clinical setting. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs [^501]  [^502] and women find this screening strategy highly acceptable [^503]  [^504]. Optimal urogenital specimen types for chlamydia screening using NAAT include first catch-urine (men) and vaginal swabs (women) [^394]. Rectal and oropharyngeal _C. trachomatis_ infection in persons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be diagnosed by testing at the anatomic site of exposure. NAATs are not FDA-cleared for use with rectal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. However, NAATs have been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and specificity compared with culture for the detection of _C. trachomatis_ at rectal sites and at oropharyngeal sites among men [^505]  [^506]  [^507]  [^508]. Some laboratories have established CLIA-defined performance specifications when evaluating rectal and oropharyngeal swab specimens for _C. trachomatis_, thereby, allowing results to be used for clinical management. Most persons with _C. trachomatis_ detected at oropharyngeal sites do not have oropharyngeal symptoms.  However, when gonorrhea testing is performed at the oropharyngeal site, chlamydia test results may be reported as well because some NAATs detect both bacteria from a single specimen. There is good evidence that performance of NAATs on self-collected rectal swabs is comparable to clinician-collected rectal swabs, and this specimen collection strategy for rectal _C. trachomatis_ screening is highly acceptable [^509]  [^510]  [^511]. Self-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable alternative to clinician-collected rectal swabs for _C. trachomatis_ screening by NAAT, especially when clinicians are not available or when self collection is preferred over clinician collection. Previous evidence suggests that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for Pap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT testing, although test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that associated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens [^512]; regardless, certain NAATs have been FDA-cleared for use on liquid-based cytology specimens.

### Treatment

Treating persons infected with _C. trachomatis_ prevents adverse reproductive health complications and continued sexual transmission, and treating their sex partners can prevent reinfection and infection of other partners. Treating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of _C. trachomatis_ to neonates during birth. Chlamydia treatment should be provided promptly for all persons testing positive for infection; treatment delays have been associated with complications (e.g., PID) in a limited proportion of women [^513].

A meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital chlamydial infection demonstrated that the treatments were equally efficacious, with microbial cure rates of 97% and 98%, respectively [^514]. These studies were conducted primarily in populations with urethral and cervical infection in which follow-up was encouraged, adherence to a 7-day regimen was effective, and culture or EIA (rather than the more sensitive NAAT) was used for determining microbiological outcome. More recent retrospective studies have raised concern about the efficacy of azithromycin for rectal _C. trachomatis_ infection [^515]  [^516], however these studies have limitations, and prospective clinical trials comparing azithromycin versus doxycycline regimens for rectal _C. trachomatis_ infection are needed. 

Although the clinical significance of oropharyngeal _C. trachomatis_ infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal screening for CT is not recommended, available evidence suggests oropharyngeal _C. trachomatis_ can be sexually transmitted to genital sites; [^152]  [^517] therefore, detection of _C. trachomatis_ from an oropharyngeal specimen should be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline.  The efficacy of alternative antimicrobial regimens in resolving oropharyngeal chlamydia remains unknown.  

In a double-blinded randomized control trial, a doxycycline delayed-release 200 mg tablet administered daily for 7 days was as effective as generic doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treatment of urogenital _C. trachomatis_ infection in men and women and had a lower frequency of gastrointestinal side effects. However, this regimen is more costly than those that involve multiple daily doses [^518]. Delayed-release doxycycline (Doryx®) 200 mg daily for 7 days may be an alternative regimen to the doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treatment of urogenital _C. trachomatis_ infection. Erythromycin might be less efficacious than either azithromycin or doxycycline, mainly because of the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects that can lead to nonadherence with treatment. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin are effective treatment alternatives, but they are more expensive and offer no advantage in the dosage regimen. Other quinolones either are not reliably effective against chlamydial infection or have not been evaluated adequately.
