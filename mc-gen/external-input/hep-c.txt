HCV screening is recommended by CDC and USPSTF for all persons born during 1945–1965 and others based on their risk for infection or on a recognized exposure, including past or current injection drug use, receiving a blood transfusion before 1992, long-term hemodialysis, being born to a mother with HCV infection, intranasal drug use, receipt of an unregulated tattoo, and other percutaneous exposures [^109]  [^224]  [^245].

### Diagnosis

Testing for HCV infection should include use of an FDA-cleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or enhanced chemiluminescence imunoassay and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody test) followed by NAAT to detect HCV RNA for those with a positive antibody result [^178]. Persons with HIV infection with low CD4-positive cell count might require further testing by NAAT because of the potential for a false-negative antibody assay.
Persons determined to be anti-HCV positive should be evaluated (by referral or consultation, if appropriate) for the presence of acute infection; presence, severity, or development of CLD; and eligibility for treatment. Nucleic acid testing, including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect HCV RNA, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of current HCV infection, and testing of liver function (alanine aminotransferase level) provides biochemical evidence of CLD.

### Treatment

Providers should consult with specialists knowledgeable about management of hepatitis C infection. Further, they can consult existing guidelines to learn about the latest advances in the management of hepatitis C [www.hcvguidelines.org](www.hcvguidelines.org).
